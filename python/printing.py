#Fireflies By Owl City
print('''You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
Cause they fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
Youd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
Id like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns slowly
Its hard to say that Id rather stay awake when Im asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems''')
